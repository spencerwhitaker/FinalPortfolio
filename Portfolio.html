        <h2>Below are descriptions of the work I did each week and screenshot examples of the code used and the final results.</h2>
        <p></p>
        Week 1:
        <br>
        This week I just set up my GitHub Repository. There was no real code written or projects made.
        <p></p>
        Week 2:
        <br>
        This week was my first introduction to the principles of coding. I used code.org to learn the basics. 
        <br>
        I started with Dance Party and had a lot of fun experimenting with different characters and movements.
        <br>
        I then moved on to Artist Lab and tried a lot of different drawing styles until I settled on something I liked.
        <br>
        Below are screenshots of my certificates of completion as well as the drawing I made in Artist Lab!

        <p></p>
        Week 3:
        <br>
        This week was my first time using Scratch to create a little story or game.
        <br>
        I learned how to use broadcasting and variables through a drag and drop format to have things happen in a sequential order.
        <br>
        For my project this week, I decided to make a little story between the two friends, a griffin and a bear. As they joked around with each other, their friendship score progressed.
        <br>
        Included below are screenshots of the final project, as well as a screenshot of the behind the scenes of my drag and drop code.

        <img src="scratch2.jpg" alt="scratch2" width="600" height="500">
        <p?=></p>
        Week 4:
        <br>
        For Week 4's projects, I went back to code.org and used Play Lab and App Lab to create a game as well as an interactive buzzfeed quiz.
        <br>
        This week was a lot more drag and drop coding, with newer concepts like movable characters and user controlled interfaces. 
        <br>
        This week was super helpful in my learning process, as it laid the groundwork and established the principles that many of my future projects built upon.
        <br>
        Below are screenshots of part of the coding process, as well as online linke to my <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/playlab/zVDnZjjvndDpdDHbgcfox8dj7MhIySEieJEA5yBt8_c">game</a> and my <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/U6Jh8bhws5pQsztcLsh-7CgIl21nUFMnzuuBw6rvD0o">app</a>.

        <p></p>
        Week 5:
        <br>
        This week was by far the most complicated and frustrating week for me, but also the coolest. 
        <br>
        I've never worked with any program like Alice before, and it was such a creatively satisfying experience to literally be able to build my own world.
        <br>
        Working with the camera and programming all the event listeners was really tedious, but very beneficial to learn for future weeks.
        <br>
        I also learned more about collisions and functions and variables. And just had a whole lot of fun building my Mars base and populating it with various characters.
        <br>
        I've included several screenshots from the coding process as well as from the finished result!!

        <img src="alice5.jpg" alt="alice5" width="1000" height="600">
        <p></p>
        Week 6:
        <br>
        This week I created this website!!
        <br>
        The html pages and all the behind the scenes stuff will be included in the zip file with everything else, and the end result is easy enough to see by clicking around the website.
        <br>
        I learned a lot about tags and hyperlinks and inserting images and just the basics of how websites operate and what aspects of them attract visitors.
        <p></p>
        Week 7:
        <br>
        Unfortunately, I fell very behind due to classes and work during homecoming week, and didn't get Week 7 completed.
        <br>
        I plan on going over the information for Week 7 during Winter Break and do my best to learn it, but the makeup work just never made it to the top of the list of things I needed to do.
        <br> 
        I bit off a bit more than I could chew this semester with 6 classes and 20-30 hours/week of work :/
        <p></p>
        Week 8:
        <br>
        Ditto with Week 7. I spent too much time trying to catch up in other classes and stay on track in this class to ever go back and make up the work for this week.
        <p></p>
        Week 9:
        <br>
        This week we started p5.js!! I learned how to use their JavaScript library and the prewritten functions to draw a self portrait.
        <br>
        This week was really all about getting comfortable with the basics of p5.js in order to build on it for the next few weeks.
        <br>
        I also learned about function setup and draw and the differences in order of when things are called and how often they are called.
        <br>
        I had a ton of fun this week figuring out how to use different shapes and lines and colors to create a visual representation of myself through code, which was a super cool.
        <br>
        Below are photos of my code and my finshed self portrait! 
        <br>
        <img src="selfportrait.jpg" alt="selfportrait" width="1000" height="600">
        <p></p>
        Week 10:
        More work in p5.js, making my self portrait from last week move. I learned how to create variables to make editing the code for several things easier.
        <br>
        Worked on figuring out how to make shapes move, stop, and bounce. Also learned about the math random functions in order to randomize variables and movements. Also got an introduction to if statements and logical operators and tons of usefull stuff.
        Pretty fun and educational week! Below is a screenshot of the code and my self portrait mid motion.
        <br>
        <img src="spmovement1.jpg" alt="spmovement" width="1000" height="600">
        <p></p>
        Week 11:
        <br>
        This was a big week. We moved on from the self portraits, and instead we built a spore-like game to learn more about p5.js with.
        <br>
        We continued with our prewritten functions from the JavaScript libary.
        <br>
        We worked with Conditionals (if, if/else, if/else if) and Logical Operators and Loops and introduced Event Handling in p5.js for the first time, both with keyboard events as well as mouse controlled events.
        <br>
        Below are screenshots of the code and my spore game in action.
        <br>
        <img src="spore.jpg" alt="spore" width="1000" height="600">
        <p></p>
        Week 12:
        <br>
        I think this was by far the shortest week (aside from Week 1), but it introduced me to the very and extremely helpful idea of building your own functions.
        <br>
        I essentially took the spore game I had last week and simplified the code by building in my own functions to make the code cleaner and more organized.
        <br>
        Below is a photo of the new code with my functions.
        <br>
        <img src="spore2.jpg" alt="spore2" width="1000" height="600">
        <p></p>
        Week 13:
        <br>
        This week was all about Arrays and learning how to use them to better organize my code and allow editing many things at once.
        <br>
        It was so cool to be able to integrate Arrays into last week's project and see how quickly I could change it, like adding 1000000 obstacles that cover the screen and then go back to 2 obstacles by just changing a single number.
        <br>
        This week felt so good, I felt like I had a near complete grasp of not only how to do something, but why that something was relevant and useful. 
        <br>
        Below is a photo with my updated code and game!!
        <br>

        <br>
        <img src="array2.jpg" alt="array2" width="800" height="800">
        <p></p>
        Week 14-14:
        <br>
        Worked on final portfolio!
        <p></p>
        Thank you so much for such a great semester!! It was so cool to learn about something completely new for me and build my knowledge from nothing to a healthy understanding of the basics of creative coding.
        <br>
        Still a bit bummed I couldn't make time to make up Weeks 7 & 8, but I learned so much the rest of the weeks and really enjoyed my time in this class!
        <br>
        Hope you enjoy the holiday break, and thanks again!
        <br>
